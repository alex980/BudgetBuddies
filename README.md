-Main (webpage and integration)  
-PageLayouts (stores layouts for each page)  
-Algorithm  
-Database  


At least 3 layouts  
-Start  
-Prompt - Kris  
-Dashboard


3 main functions to call from Algorithm  
-ticker data (gets necessary data from entered ticker)  
-trade comps (returns 3 calculated share prices)  
-DCF (returns an implied share price and a few data points)


Database - Polly  
-Create table with necessary variables  
-Check if ticker is in database  
-Check if date stored matches most recent date


Main   
-webpage functionality  
-input/output (take in data, call function, return output)


Error Checking - Alexis  
-check if tickers enter exist  
-check if data needed exists


Problems  
-unreliable data (ex. POWI) *Improved   
-negative numbers  *Set to zero but still thats the right move
-stock graph (line, candlestick) *Still need look at how to pull dates
-Dashboard sizes  *possibly minimally improved, not fixed
-dates input uncessary maybe  
-Get average yearly growth input
