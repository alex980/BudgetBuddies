Problem Statement

It can be difficult for an investor, especially a novice, to determine whether a stock is worth purchasing. There are some services like Morningstar which provide a rating and a “fair valuation” but Morningstar doesn’t cover every stock nor does everyone have access to such services. One could then do their own research and calculations, which can be time-consuming and difficult.  
 
Project Overview

Our team is proposing creating a program which automates the task of collecting data and making calculations in order to determine a potential fair value of a given stock. This will be done based on existing financial models like trading comps and the discount cash flow model. The user will enter a stock ticker and a few other pieces of information, the program will then collect data and make calculations based on the algorithm we create. Once finished it will display data backed to the user. This will provide them will useful information that they might not otherwise have and help in making an investment decision.
 
Goals
1.	Construct and algorithm that makes calculations based on automatically pulled data
2.	Develop a dashboard that provides a user-friendly experience and displays data in an understandable way.
3.	Make an SQL database which can store previously calculated data 
Stretch Goals
1.	Expand the information provided to the user for more comprehensive analysis
Specifications
	The program will be built in python, utilizing the yfinance library and the SEC’s fred api. SQL will be used to create the database. The team comps and DCF financial models will be incorporated into the algorithm.
